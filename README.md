# üá∞üáø Awesome Made in Kazakhstan [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of open source projects that were made and extensively contributed to by developers from Kazakhstan üá∞üáø.

## Motivation

Software development industry is growing faster than ever in Kazakhstan. Despite the fact that it was introduced not that long ago in our country, there are already developers who managed to contribute to the worldwide community by making open-source projects and contributing to them.

Yet maybe there are not that many of them, but we need to understand that the open-source software culture is only emerging in our country and we need to support it.

Goal of this list is to foster open-source & software engineering culture in Kazakhstan by highlighting the Kazakhstani part of your `package.json`, `Podfile`, `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile` & etc.

A lot of developers in Kazakhstan do not know about awesome projects made by their fellow countrymen, yet it undoubtedly warms your heart when you see that one of our developers made a piece of software that helps & used by people out there in the world.

## Contributing

This list includes projects under this criteria:

1. The project has over _100 stars_
2. The project's creator or maintainer was born in Kazakhstan
3. The project creator or maintainer self-identify themselves as Kazakh/Kazakhstani

If these conditions are met, feel free to open a PR.<br>
When submitting changes please check that you have picked the category correctly and added the project according to descending order of stars.

Feel free to add new section (number of stars range) if the appropriate one doesn't exist yet.

If you are aware of some project that meets the above criteria alongside with the approval of the author himself - feel free to submit PR too!

### Promising projects

Rationale behind submitting projects to _Promising_ is quite intuitive, but it is hard to formulate it, but let's give it a shot:

- Project needs to already have some initial traction and prove their usefulness to the community. It is really hard to formulate this criteria in terms of numbers of stars, so for now the process of submission will be on-premise and bit subjective.
- This section shouldn't serve as an advertisement platform for the projects, it is more of a showcase of already established projects with traction (no inference made to the number of stars here, project could be really well established and with a great value to community but have less than 100 stars)

All in all, submission to the _Promising_ section will be discussed in the PR all members of the community are welcome to join. This makes the process quite cumbersome and subjective though, but it's the best we can do for now.
